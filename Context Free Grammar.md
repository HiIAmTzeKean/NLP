# CFG
> [!summary] Idea that language can be represented by grammar which generalises the formulation

Also known as Phrase structure grammar.

Follow from [[Syntactic constituency]] and CFG, we can from sentences from tags and words. Thus, it does follow that a given sentence can also be parsed, the idea of parsing with phase structure is known as [[Constituency parsing]] . [[Phrase structure]] to organise words into nested constituents.

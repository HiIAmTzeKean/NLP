# Constituency parsing

We want to perform parsing on the the constituency which is the assigning of a syntactic structure to the sentence.

Use case of parsing
- Grammar checking
- Semantic analysis

Challenge: [[Structural ambiguity]]

To solve the challenge, we can do parsing through use of [[Dynamic programming]] to find the solution with the highest probability.

[[Cocke Kasami Yonge algorithm]] can be used but we must first transform the grammars into [[Chomsky normal form]].

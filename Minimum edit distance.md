# Minimum edit distance
The minimum number of edit operations needed to transform $s_1$ to $s_2$. This transform can be used as a metric on the similarity between 2 strings.
## Algorithm
We can use 3 base operations to define the solution
- Insert
- Replace
- Delete  
Use of [[Dynamic programming]] will reduce the search space of the problem.
## Use case
- Spelling error correction
- Alignment of 2 string for translation
